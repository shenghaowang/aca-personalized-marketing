## ðŸ“¦ Installation

While Docker is the recommended method for setting up the environment, the following steps provide a quick alternative using a Python virtual environment:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-classification-cnn-lstm.git
cd text-classification-cnn-lstm
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Install the `pre-commit` hooks**
```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```
